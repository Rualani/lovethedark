# Hello, and welcome to the readme for this simple 2d action game, where you're a chill fireball that throws fireballs at the spooky shadows!

# Steps for installation and playing!
1) Download the love 2d game engine from https://love2d.org/
2) Download this repository however you want. I find it easier to put the game folder on the desktop.
3) The love 2d game icon needs to be placed on the desktop too. It looks like a circular heart shaped thing... Or maybe it's squarish...
4) Now... You drag the gaming folder ONTO the 2d game icon and the engine automatically does the rest for you

# Controls
WASD to move the chill firedude around.
Mouse1 to shoot fireballs. Just shoot fireballs and clear as many shadows as you can before GAME OVER
